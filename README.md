# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows both **single-player** (against AI) and **multiplayer** modes. It includes a user input form for entering player names, dynamic UI updates, and a minimax algorithm for AI decisions.

## Features

- **Single-player**: Play against the AI using the minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- **Multiplayer**: Play with another person on the same device.
- **Name Input**: Enter custom names for players at the start of the game.
- **Restart Game**: Restart the game at any point with the click of a button.
- **Responsive Design**: Works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
